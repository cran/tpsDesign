\title{
  Plot function for power, based on two-phase and case-control design
}
\description{
 The \code{plotPower} function plots estimates of power obtained from objects returned by either the \code{tpsPower} or \code{ccPower} functions. 
}
\usage{
plotPower(x, coefNum=1, include="All", yAxis=seq(from=0, to=100, by=20),
          xAxis=NULL, main=NULL, legendXY=NULL)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{x}{
    An object in a class \code{tpsPower} or \code{ccPower} obtained as a result of \code{\link{tpsPower}} or \code{\link{ccPower}} functions, respectively.
  }
  \item{coefNum}{
    A numeric vector number specifying the regression coefficient in \code{beta} for the plot.
  }
  \item{include}{
    Character string indicating which estimators from a \code{tpsPower} object are to be printed. The default is "All" in which case all four estimators (two-phase WL, PL, ML and case-control CC) are presented. Other options include "TPS" which solely presents the three two-phase estimators; options "WL", "PL", "ML" and "CC" solely present the corresponding estimators. If the object is of class \code{ccPower} then only the case-control MLE (CC) is presented (i.e., the \code{include} argument is ignored).
}
  \item{yAxis}{
    A scale marking the y-axis for the plot.
  }
  \item{xAxis}{
    A scale marking the x-axis for the plot. If left as the default \code{NULL}, the x-axis scale is taken from \code{nII} in the \code{tpsResults} object.
  }
  \item{main}{
    Title for the plot. 
  }
  \item{legendXY}{
    Optional vector indicating the co-ordinates for the top-left hand corner of the legend box.
  }
}
\details{
Produces a plot of statistical power (to reject a null hypothesis H0: beta = 0), for estimators of a regression coefficient from a logistic regression model, based on a two-phase and/or case-control design.
